# Mariodux
[Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), and [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom)

## Motivation
Migrating an existing project to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is not always an option.

Here, I have outlined a basic pattern for how Redux and morphdom can be added to an exisitng Marionette project to provide the benefit of popular React and Redux features; specifically, DOM diffing andunidirectional data flow.

## Todo Example
This is a recreation of [Redux Todos](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos), using the aforementioned libraries.

## Getting Started
Run `bower install`
