# Mariodux
Demonstration on how [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) can be added to a  [Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette) project in order to provide the benefit of popular [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) features — specifically, DOM diffing and unidirectional data flow.

## Motivation
I currently work on a 3-year-old Marionette application; migrating to React or any other framework would be a massive effort. I began this repo seeking to determine whether it was possible to replicate the Flux pattern within a Marionette application.

The results proved interesting …

## The Approach
We start by creating [two versions of the application's root layout](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/index.js#L15-L16).
```js
var root = new Root();
var virtualRoot = new Root();
```
The true root is attached to the document and will continue to serve as a representation of our application state.
```js
app.rootRegion.show(root);
```
The virtual root will essentially act as the worker. It will be re-rendererd when changes are made to the app's global state object. An HTML representation of it will then be diffed against the representation currently in the DOM in order to make efficient updates.

## Priciples
Following the [Redux principles](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html), views will leverage [pure functions](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/reducers/todos.js#L10-L43) to update their models, [dispatching events](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/components/TodoList.js#L53-L55) rather than setting properties on models directly.
```js
onClick: function() {
  dispatch(toggleTodo(this.$el.attr('modelId')));
}
```
In doing so, a new global state object will be generated by  [combineReducers](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/reducers/index.js#L9-L12) and the `updateDOM` function will execute, rendering the virutalRoot using the new global state.

An HTML representation of this latest rendering will then be diffed against the representation currently in the DOM.
```js
store.subscribe(function updateDOM() {
  var realDOM = root.$el[0];
  var virtualDOM = virtualRoot.render().$el[0];
  morphdom(realDOM, virtualDOM);
});
```
**The true root will not be re-rendered.** It is only rendered once at the beginning. From then on, morphdom will handle all future updates.

## Shift In Mindset

This approach largely ignores the event systems provided in Backbone and Marionette in favor of a single dispatcher and pure functions. **Using this approach, views should only be concerned with rendering and dispatching.**

## Gotchas
### Discreet Event Listeners
As an alternative to the complexities of [React's synthetic event system](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html), our [views will continue to listen for DOM events](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/components/TodoList.js#L30-L32).
```js
events: {
  click: 'onClick'
}
```
One particular issue that arises when coupling discreet event listeners with DOM diffing is that the DOM node may be presenting data which is not part the view's model.

This is most apparent in the provided [async example](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/tree/master/examples/async) where views hold reference to thier `li` nodes whose text may have been replaced by morphdom. At this point, the view's node is presenting data that is not in the view's model.

**Workaround:**

In order to ensure the dispatcher is provided the correct `model.id`, we store the model's id on the node in a custom attribute, `modelId`. This way, [the proper id can be used when notifying the dispatcher](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/components/TodoList.js#L54).

### Node onAttach
If the view needs to know where its node has been attached to the document, we can leverage callbacks like morphdom's   [`onNodeAdded`](
https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/async/index.js#L26-L30) in order to trigger a custom event and [listen for that event in the view](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/async/components/Posts.js#L14-L16).
```js
morphdom(realDOM, virtualDOM, {
  onNodeAdded: function(node) {
    if (node.hasAttribute('ref')) {
      $(node).trigger('added', node);
    }
  }
});
```
You'll notice we've followed suit to React and tagged desired nodes with the [`ref` attribute](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute).

### Maintianing Browser State
If we need to get the value of the nodes such as `inputs` before we update the DOM, we can leverage morphdom's [`onBeforeElUpdated`](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/index.js#L29-L32).
```js
morphdom(realDOM, virtualDOM, {
  onBeforeElUpdated: function(fromEl, toEl) {
    if (fromEl.hasAttribute('ref')) {
      $(toEl).trigger('before:update', fromEl);
    }
  }
});
```
Doing so allows us to [check the value of the input](https://github.com/AndrewHenderson/mariodux/blob/master/examples/todos/components/AddTodo.js#L32-L35) before updating the DOM.
```js
onBeforeUpdateInput: function(e, fromEl) {
  var $fromEl = $(fromEl);
  this.ui.input.val($fromEl.val());
}
```
### Overrding ChildView.remove
Since morpdom is now tasked with managing the DOM, we override Marionette's `ChildView.remove`. Doing so allows morphdom to update the DOM efficiently. Othwerise, morphdom would see more additions than are actually necessary.
